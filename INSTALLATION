INSTALLATION
============

This theme requires rEFInd to be installed.  Change directory to the rEFInd directory, where refind_x64.efi is located
on your system (on Linux, usually located at /boot/EFI/refind or /boot/efi/EFI/refind) and, if necessary, create the
subdirectory "themes":

    cd /boot/EFI/refind
    mkdir themes



Clone the metal directory to the themes directory:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/perthshiretim/refind-metal-theme.git metal



Include the metal/theme.conf to refind.conf (located in the rEFInd directory):

    echo -e "\ninclude themes/metal/theme.conf\n" >> refind.conf



The file theme.conf assumes a resolution of 1920x1080 for your monitor. If necessary, change this by modifying the first
line of theme.conf to something appropriate (self-explanatory).
